    <h1 class="pl">FACTS</h1>
    <p>Blogging is a very immediate medium: When you publish a post, it usually goes live on your blog right away. In fact, several things typically happen the moment you click the Publish button:

      The post appears at the top of your blog’s home page.
      
      The blogging software adds the post to your blog’s archive, usually by both date and subject, and to your RSS feed, which gets updated in newsreaders.
      
      Anyone who signed up for e-mail notifications receives an e-mail about your post.
      
      If your blog software pings blog search engines and services, those search engines and services receive a notice from your blog software that you’ve updated your blog and put that information into their catalogs. (A ping is simply an electronic notification.) Users of search engine websites can then get your blog post as a result of a search.
      
      A search-engine crawler indexes the post the next time it visits your blog.
      
      All these changes happen regardless of whether you think about them. The fact that blog posts are quickly distributed with a minimum of effort on the part of the blogger is part of the beauty and effectiveness of this format.
